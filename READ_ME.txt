### READ ME for alignment-free network of 143 prokaryote genomes ###

# This visualisation works on Firefox, Chrome and Safari but hasn't been tested on Windows Explorer.

# The search function accept incomplete search, i.e. "strept" for "streptococcus", but it is case sensitive. You can get the name of each node by pointing your mouse on it.

# You can click and drag to pinpoint a node, then click again on the node to release it.

# Double click on a node to visualise ontly the node and edges connected to it (all other nodes/edges will be transparent). Double click on any nodes to cancel it.

# Click and drag the threshold (or use your keyboard <- ->) to change the structure of the graph (steps = 0.5).

# Right click to stop the force layout (can be useful at very low threshold if it takes to much time to finish). Move a node to start the force again.

### Known issue ###

# At the biginning the threshold bar shows t = 5 but it is 0 in reality.
